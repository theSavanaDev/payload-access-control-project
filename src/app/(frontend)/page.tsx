					<p className="py-5">
						Access Control is one of Payload's most important featuresâ€”it's way more powerful than a typical RBAC pattern, which is often
						inflexible when it comes to document-based or even field-based permissions. With Payload's access control, you can build incredibly
						powerful and secure apps.
					</p>

					<p className="py-3">
						Payload's admin UI automatically responds to the access control that you define. For example, if a user can't edit a document, the
						"Publish" button will be automatically removed. If a user can't edit a field, the field is automatically set to read-only in the
						admin UI. If a user can't create new documents in a collection, the "Create New" function will be disabled throughout all of the
						admin UI.
					</p>

					<p className="py-3">**The best part is that it's all done in clean, declarative, easy-to-read code.**</p>
